# Confident Interval and Hypothesis Testing (Coursera `Inferential Statistical Analysis with Python`)
* Week 2
  * Define a confidence interval
  * Determine assumptions needed to calculate confidence intervals for their respective population parameter
  * Calculate confidence intervals by hand for one population proportion, difference in two population proportions, one population mean, one population mean difference for paired data, and difference in population means for independent groups
  * Demonstrate your understanding of confidence intervals by communicating statistical ideas clearly and concisely for a potential client
  * Create confidence intervals in Python

* Week 3
  * Differentiate between various scenarios and determine the appropriate analysis method
  * Apply techniques of hypothesis testing and interpret the results
  * Run hypothesis tests in Python and interpret the output.

* Week 4
  * Understand how the inferential procedures introduced in earlier weeks are married to well-formulated research questions
  * Review how the inferential procedures are applied and interpreted step by step when analyzing real data
  * Understand how accounting for complex sample designs can affect the inferential procedures discussed
